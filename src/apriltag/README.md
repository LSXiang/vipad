# AprilTag

AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. 
Targets can be created from an ordinary printer, and the AprilTag detection software computes the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the camera. 
The AprilTag library is implemented in C with no external dependencies. It is designed to be easily included in other applications, as well as be portable to embedded devices. 
Real-time performance can be achieved even on cell-phone grade processors.

## Brief Introduction

Program development based on AprilTag, streamlining most redundant programs to facilitate migration to non-system platforms.
